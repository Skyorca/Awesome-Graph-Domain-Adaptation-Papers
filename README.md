### :sparkles:Awesome-Graph-Domain-Adaptation:sparkles:

This repository contains the paper list of **Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) **. The existing literature can be mainly categorized into three categories from conceptually different perspectives, i.e., *source*, *adaptation*, and *target*, based on their positions in the adaptation pipeline.  Besides, we also provide some dimensions to capture important information for each work, including task granularity, homogenous/heterogenous,  and code-link(link on the model name if accessible). 

:blush:We will try our best to make this paper list updated. If you notice some related papers missing, do not hesitate to contact us.

update: our survey paper is online
